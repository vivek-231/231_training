Project 1: Smart String Transformation Analyzer

Implements a Dynamic Programming–based edit distance algorithm to compute the minimum number of changes required to convert one string into another.

Key Concepts:

Levenshtein Distance

Dynamic Programming

String similarity

Example:

Input : START → STARE  
Output: Transformation Cost = 1

🔹 Project 2: Text Normalization Pipeline for NLP

A lightweight text preprocessing pipeline that cleans raw sentences and converts them into meaningful tokens.

Operations:

Lowercasing

Regex-based word extraction

Stop word removal

Rule-based stemming

Example Output:

['quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jump', 'lazy', 'dogs']

🔹 Project 3: Rule-Based Spam Message Identifier

A simple keyword-based spam detection system that classifies messages as spam or not spam.

Spam Detection Method:

Case-insensitive keyword matching

Output:

"spam" if spam keywords found

"not spam" otherwise

🔹 Project 4: Text Sanitization Module for Sentiment Analysis

Prepares text data for sentiment analysis by removing unnecessary noise.

Cleaning Includes:

Removing hashtags

Removing special characters

Stop word filtering

Tokenization

Example:

Input : I Love this movie!!! #awesome  
Output: ['love', 'movie']

🔹 Project 5: Intelligent Typo Correction using Weighted Edit Distance

An advanced string distance system that improves typo correction by considering keyboard proximity along with edit distance.

Use Case:

Spell checking

Autocorrect systems

Example:

Typed   : HELLP  
Correct : HELLO

Technologies Used

Python

Regular Expressions (re module)

Dynamic Programming
